# ðŸ“š Library Chain Management System

This repository contains the full evolution of a library chain management system. The application simulates the operations of a library network with three user roles: **Employee**, **Manager**, and **Administrator**.

The project is implemented in **Java** and structured across multiple stages, each highlighting a different architectural pattern or software design concept.
